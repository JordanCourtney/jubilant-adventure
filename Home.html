            <p>Deltarune is a role-playing video game created by American indie developer Toby Fox. The player controls a human, Kris, in a world inhabited by monsters. Kris and a classmate named Susie fall into an unknown place called the “Dark World” where they meet Ralsei, who informs them that they are heroes destined to restore balance to the world. The players meet various beings who call themselves "Darkners" during a prophesied quest to seal the duplicate Dark Fountain. Mainly through the combat system, the player navigates through different kinds of bullet hell attacks by enemies, which can be resolved peacefully or through violence.</p>

                <p>FAQ</p>
                 <li>Q) How does this game relate to UNDERTALE? Is it a sequel? </li>
                <br>
                <li>A) Please don't worry too much about that. Essentially, this is not the world of UNDERTALE. If you completed UNDERTALE, the ending and world are as you left it. If everyone was happy there, the people in the UNDERTALE world will still be happy. So, please don't worry about those characters, and that world. It will remain untouched.To rephrase that, DELTARUNE's world is a different one. With different characters, that have lived different lives. A whole new story will happen... I don't know what you call this kind of game. It's just a game you can play after you complete UNDERTALE, if you want to. <br> 
                <br>
                That's all.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Q) So there's no connections between the two games?</li>
                <br>
                <li>A) It's a different world that might even have different rules. That doesn't mean there will be no connections at all though.</li>
